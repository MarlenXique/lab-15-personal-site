      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>   As I said on my home page, I am 18 years old and I live in brooklyn, New York. I’ve lived here my entire life and in the same street for about 13 years now. And before that I lived two blocks away. I've only traveled once out-of-state. I have a lot of hobbies, I like baking, sewing, embroidering, painting, and drawing. I feel like I always have to keep my hands full. I think that's why i have so many hobbies. I had different career plans in highschool than i do now. Now I want to create games either in coding or design. Back in highschool, I wanted to be an animator, I wanted to make cartoons. But things change.</p></div>

      <h2>Why I Started Coding</h2>
      <p>I was actually put into an emerging media technology major by accident and when I realized it wasn't what I intended to study, it was too late to change it. I wanted to be in this school to learn how to animate and work with pixar. Turns out though, I really enjoy coding. This is my first semester learning anything about code. Which gets really hard sometimes because of the different amount of coding languages that I’m learning right now. But at the same time, I don't mind the work for time because I really do enjoy coding.</p></div>
