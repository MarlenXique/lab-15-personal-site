      <h2>Photoshop</h2>
      <p>
        In my MTEC1005 class we were taught how to crop and edit photos for our website. We were taught mostly to do stuff like edit the size to your liking, add text, and add filters (like black and white). But for this personal project I edited it in ways like: adding shadows, lighting, and blurs.</p></div>

    <div class="stuff" id="second"><h2>Python</h2>
      <p>
        In my CST 1101 class I am learning only python. This code was to make the user tell how many parking lots there's going to be and see how many are taken and available.. Then you'll be able to park your car in a random given spot and you can take it out whenever. I didn't work on this alone though, I had two other group members that worked on this too.</p></div>

      <div class="stuff" id="third"><h2>My First Website!</h2>
      <p2><a href= "https://marlenxique.github.io/bibliography/">Learn about the benefits of becoming vegan!</a></p2>
      <p>In my english class, we had to create research topics and then we were able to freely create something to get the word out. Whether it be a podcast, or a youtube video, anything. What I did was create a website. I created this website because I wanted to test my html and css knowledge. It came out well and everything works. Although this isn't exactly my first ever site. Itâ€™s my first ever public website. Click the link above for another website I created and with a totally different theme.

    <div class="stuff" id="second"><h2>Drawing</h2>
      <p>
        I drew this using prismacolor colored pencils for the skin and hair. It took me about a month to finish that completely. Then I used watercolor for the background. I used toned paper and a tiny bit of white ink for highlights.

    <div class="stuff" id="second"><h2>Embroidery</h2>
      <p>
        I learned how to do embroidery from a young age, because my mom taught me. Here is an example of it on my backpack. It took me about two days to finish this. I did this using embroidery yarn and a thick needle to rip through the backpacks layer.</p></div>
